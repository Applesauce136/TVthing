Things to figure out:
>
* Facebook (this probably won't get done this term because the app needs to be finished first for facebook review permissions): 
  * log in through facebook
  * get user's 'likes' 
  * get user's friends + friends likes (if possible) 
  * send notifications through facebook 
* front end design
* APIs (Elise is working on): 
      * TVmaze API 
      * Guidebox API 
      * TVDB - tv show information
      * Netflix - more information + past shows
      * trakt.tv - tracks what you watch
      * vizimo - recommender for TV shows
* Twilio - not free 
* phoneGap - how does this even work

Calender(ish):
>
* 1/7-9 (because we've been so busy doing other things during the break and need time to reconvene)
  * Fawn - get landing page + base page when logged in, dummy user design?
  * Elise - figure out Facebook
  * Sappha - work with Elise to figure out FB, OAuth?, database things
* 1/12

* 1/16
  * Reccomendations based on what you watched - pull netflix, vizimo
* 1/19
  * Twilio? or a free subsitute
